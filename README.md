# Data Analysis Project

## Trump, Tweets and Trade!!!

The purpose of this project is to create a Data Analysis project using Python and collaborating with Git. Trump, Tweets and Trade!!! is an analysis of President Trump's Tweets and whether they affect the stock market prices or not. Data exploration and cleanup was performed with Excel and Pandas while Matplotlib was used for Time Series visualizations of the data. 

Our motivation is to answer the question: ***Is there a correlation between President Trump's tweets and market prices?***
  
We used 2 methods to derive at the conclusion: *Visualization Plots and Regression Analysis*
Our conclusion is in two parts: 
    Part 1: With the Visualization Plots we do see a correlation between Tweets and Stock prices.
    Part 2: With Regression Analysis we found that it's not just the Tweets that affect the Stocks, there are other factors that affect them as well.
