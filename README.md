# Data Analysis Project

## Trump, Tweets and Trade!!!

The purpose of this project is to create a Data Analysis project using Python and project collaboration with Git. Trump, Tweets and Trade!!! is an analysis of Trump's Tweets and how it affects the stock market prices and figure out if there is a correlation or not. Data exploration and cleanup was performed with Excel and Pandas while Matplotlib was used for Time Series visualizations of the data. 

Our motivation is to answer the question: 
  **Is there a correlation between President Trump's tweets and market prices?**
We used 2 methods to derive at the conclusion: *Visualization Plots and Regression Analysis*
Our conclusion is given in two parts: 
Part 1: With the Visualization Plots we do see a correlation between Tweets and stock prices
Part 2: With Regression Analysis we found out that it's not just the Tweets that affect the stock prices, there are other impacting factors as well.
